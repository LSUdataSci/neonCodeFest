## Welcome to the NEON codeFest!!


### The challenge

Species extinctions are increasing, and other species are invading new areas, such that the number of species that occupy any given area is changing over time. Understanding this change is a fundamental goal of ecology. Your challenge, should you chose to accept it, is to forecast the number of small mammal species across a set of long-term monitoring sites across the United States of America. How you generate your predictions is entirely up to you and your group. 










### The data

Small mammal data 


((Eric can probably fill this in better than I can right now))




2014-2019 train
2020 evaluation










### Scoring and evaluation

Teams will predict the number of small mammal species at each site, following the prediction template file (`predictionTemplate.csv`). Forecasts will be assessed using root-mean squared error, which measures the squared difference between the projected species richness and the true value.

### The prizes

There will be prizes for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place in terms of best predictive model. There will also be a wildcard prize for 'most inventive approach', which will be left up the disretion of a set of three judges. 












### The code of conduct

We use the Contributor Covenant as a code of conduct (`codeOfConduct.md` file in this repo). Violations of this code will result in immediate action.
