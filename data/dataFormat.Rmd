`data.frame` with the following columns and date ranges:

+ year (2014-2019 for training data, 2020 for test data)
+ season (3 month spans 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12 month)
+ latitude and longitude
+ species richness (per site)
+ abundance (mean plot estimate per site, standardized by trapping effort)

maybe?
+ plant diversity at the site per season/year
+ annual-level variation that can capture spatial differences (e.g., mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation, temperature seasonality, etc. for each year if available).
